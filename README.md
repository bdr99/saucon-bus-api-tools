# Saucon Bus API Tools
This repository contains code for interacting with the [Saucon](https://www.saucontds.com/) Bus API. This API is used by the mobile app for several bus companies.

The code implements the key generation algorithm used by the mobile app. The implementation was created by decompiling the [Trans-Bridge Lines](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=saucon.android.transbridge) Android app.

This is a proof of concept and is not in a usable state on its own, but should be enough to get started.
